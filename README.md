My solution to the Harver's Cat Card Application Technical Assessment.


## Instructions: 

Dear Software Engineer,
I have written an innovative new application! The code is in the accompanying JS file. It uses Cat as a Service (https://cataas.com) and does the following:
1. Fetches an image of a cat with some custom text
2. Fetches an image of another cat with some more custom text 3. Binds these images together into one image
4. Saves the resulting image as a file
But I need your help with a few things...

The Task
My coding skills are a bit rusty. Refactor my application to improve, harden and modernize the code. Be prepared to verbally rationalize the changes you make. Wrapping it up in a package with a proper package.json would be a good start.
Tips
Aim for
• Simplicity (less is more!)
• Maintainability
• Performance
This is a short exercise. Aim to spend approximately 1 hour.
Zip your code up and share it with us or, alternatively, put it in a public Git repo.
Good luck!
